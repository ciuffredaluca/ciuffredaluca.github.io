[Here](https://ciuffredaluca.github.io/) I collect some thoughts and ideas about anything related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, neuroscience and physics that I find interesting to share :)

*Trumpet*, [Jean-Michel Basquiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat), 1984. I just really like this painting.
