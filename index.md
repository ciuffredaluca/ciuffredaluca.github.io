Hi, my name is Luca! I like reading papers. Over the years I've spent some time reading stuff about *physics*, *neuroscience* and *artificial intelligence* but at the moment I spend most of my time developing *machine learning* models at [*Prometeia*](https://www.prometeia.it/en/home). When really inspired I might lift weights or write something here.
